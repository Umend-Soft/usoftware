<h2>HTML Images</h2>

Images are a staple of any web designer, so it is very important that you understand how to use them properly. 
Use the &lt;img /&gt; tag to place an image on your web page.
<hr>

<h2>Example</h2>
<blockquote style="background-color:#F0FFFF;padding:5px 5px 5px 5px;">
<h2>Logos :</h2>
<img border="0" src="logo.png" width="250px" height="250px" alt="Pulpit Rock" />
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>HTML
Images - The &lt;img&gt; Tag and the Src Attribute
</h2>
In HTML, images are defined with the &lt;img&gt; tag.&nbsp;
<hr>

The &lt;img&gt; tag&nbsp;is empty, which means that it contains attributes
only, and has no closing tag.
<hr>

To display an image on a page, you need to use the src attribute. Src stands for
&quot;source&quot;. The value of the src attribute is the URL of the image you want to
display.
<hr>

<b>Syntax for defining an image:</b><hr>

<blockquote style="background-color:#F0FFFF;padding:5px 5px 5px 5px;">
&lt;img src=&quot;<i>url</i>&quot; alt=&quot;<i>some_text</i>&quot;/&gt;
</blockquote>

The URL points to the location where the image is stored.
<hr>

The browser displays the image where the &lt;img&gt; tag occurs in the document. If you put an image tag between two
paragraphs, the browser shows the first paragraph, then the image, and then the second
paragraph.
<hr>

Above we have defined the src attribute. Src stands for source, the source of the image or more appropriately, 
where the picture file is located. As with links described in a previous lesson, 
you may use any standard URL to properly point the src attribute to a local or external source.
There are two ways to define the source of an image. First you may use a standard URL. 
( As your second choice, you may copy or upload the file onto your web server and access it locally using standard directory tree methods. 
(src="../sunset.gif") The location of this picture file is in relation to your location of your .html file.
<hr>

<h2>
HTML
Images - The Alt Attribute</h2>

The required alt attribute specifies an alternate text for an image, if the 
image cannot be displayed.<hr>


The value of
the alt attribute is an author-defined text:
<hr>

<blockquote style="background-color:#F0FFFF;padding:5px 5px 5px 5px;">
&lt;img src=&quot;boat.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Big Boat&quot; /&gt;
</blockquote>
The alt attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for 
some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src 
attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).<hr>

<hr />
<h2>
HTML
Images - Set Height and Width of an Image</h2>

The height and width attributes are used to specify the height and width of an 
image.<hr>


The attribute values are specified in pixels by default:<hr>

<blockquote style="background-color:#F0FFFF;padding:5px 5px 5px 5px;">
&lt;img src=&quot;pulpit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pulpit rock&quot; width=&quot;304&quot; height=&quot;228&quot; /&gt;
</blockquote>

<strong>Tip:</strong> It is a good practice to specify both the height and width 
attributes for an image. If these attributes are set, the space required for the 
image is reserved when the page is loaded. However, without these attributes, 
the browser does not know the size of the image. The effect will be that the 
page layout will change during loading (while the images load).<hr>

<hr />

<h2>Basic Notes - Useful Tips</h2>
<b>Note:</b> If an HTML file contains ten images - eleven files are required to display the page
right. Loading images takes time, so my best advice is: Use images carefully.
<hr>

<b>Note:</b> When a web page is loaded, it is the browser, at that moment, 
that actually gets the image from a web server and inserts it into the page. 
Therefore, make sure that the images actually stay in the same spot in relation 
to the web page, otherwise your visitors will get a broken link icon. The broken 
link icon is shown if the browser cannot find the image.

				  <h1>Html - 16. Frames</h1>
				  
<h2>HTML Frames</h2>
Frames allow for multiple ".html" documents to be displayed inside of one browser window at a time. 
This means that one page has no content on it, but rather tells the browser which web pages you would like to open. 
With the addition of CSS and PHP, frames have become outdated, but if you wish to use them, read on.
<hr>

With frames, you can display more than one HTML document in the same browser
window. Each HTML document is called a frame, and each frame is independent of
the others.<hr>


The disadvantages of using frames are:<hr>


<ul>
  <li>Frames are not expected to be supported in future versions of HTML</li>
  <li>Frames are difficult to use. (Printing the entire page is difficult).</li>
	<li>The web developer must keep track of more HTML documents</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h2>The HTML frameset Element</h2>
The frameset element holds one or more frame elements. Each frame element 
can hold a separate document.<hr>

The frameset element states HOW MANY columns or rows there will be in the 
frameset, and HOW MUCH percentage/pixels of space will occupy each of them.<hr>

<hr />
<h2>The HTML frame Element</h2>
The &lt;frame&gt; tag defines one particular window (frame) within a frameset.<hr>

In the example below we have a frameset with two columns.<hr>

The first column is
set to 25% of the width of the browser window. The second column is set to 75%
of the width of the browser window. The document &quot;frame_a.htm&quot; is
put into the first column, and the document &quot;frame_b.htm&quot; is put
into the second column:<hr>

<blockquote style="background-color:#F0FFFF;padding:5px 5px 5px 5px;">
&lt;frameset cols=&quot;25%,75%&quot;&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;frame src=&quot;frame_a.htm&quot; /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;frame src=&quot;frame_b.htm&quot; /&gt;<br />
&lt;/frameset&gt;
</blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> The frameset column size can also be set in pixels 
(cols=&quot;200,500&quot;), and one of the columns can be set to use the remaining space, 
with an asterisk 
(cols=&quot;25%,*&quot;).<br />
<hr>

<hr />

<h2>Basic Notes - Useful Tips</h2>

<b>Tip:</b> If a frame has visible borders, the user can resize it by dragging
the border. To prevent a user from doing this, you can add noresize=&quot;noresize&quot; to
the &lt;frame&gt; tag.<hr>


<b>Note:</b> Add the &lt;noframes&gt; tag for browsers that do not
support frames.<hr>

<b>Important:</b> You cannot use the &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; tags together with the 
&lt;frameset&gt;&lt;/frameset&gt; tags! However, if you add a &lt;noframes&gt; tag containing some 
text for browsers that do not support frames, you will have to enclose the text 
in &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; tags! See how it is done in the first example below.<hr>

Frames can be simple and well organized. However, they are usually viewed as unacceptable by most web designers.<br>
Always set the scrolling and resize options to optimize loadtime.<Br>
Using a simple menu/content frame design can reduce updates to massive sites.<Br>
 Instead of updating the menu on each page, you could simply update the menu.html file and be done with it!

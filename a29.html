<h2>Webserver</h2>
To make your web site visible to the world, you'll 
have to store it on a web server.<hr>

<hr />
<h2>Hosting your own Web site</h2>
Hosting your web site on your own server is always an option. Here are some 
points 
to consider:<hr>

<h2>Hardware Expenses</h2>
To run a &quot;real&quot; web site, you will have to buy some powerful 
server hardware. Don't expect that a low cost PC will do the job. You will also 
need a permanent (24 hours a day ) high-speed connection.<hr>

<h2>Software Expenses</h2>
Remember that 
server-licenses often are higher than client-licenses. Also note that server-licenses might have limits on number of users.<hr>

<h2>Labor Expenses</h2>

Don't expect low labor expenses. You have to install your own 
hardware and software. You also have to deal with bugs and viruses, and keep your 
server constantly running in an environment where &quot;everything could happen&quot;.<hr>


<hr />

<h2>Using an Internet Service Provider</h2>

Renting a server from an Internet Service Provider (ISP) is a common option. <hr>

Most small companies store their web site on a server provided by an ISP. Here are some 
advantages:<hr>


<h2>Connection Speed</h2>

Most ISPs have very fast connections to the Internet.<hr>


<h2>Powerful Hardware</h2>

ISPs often have powerful web servers that can be shared by 
several companies. You can also expect them to have an effective load balancing, 
and necessary backup servers. <hr>


<h2>Security and Stability</h2>

ISPs are specialists on web hosting. Expect their 
servers to have more than 99% up time, the latest software patches, and the best 
virus protection.<hr>


<hr />

<h2>Things to Consider with an ISP</h2>

<h2>24-hour support</h2>

Make sure your ISP offers 24-hours support. Don't put 
yourself in a situation where you cannot fix critical problems without having to 
wait until the next working day. Toll-free phone could be vital if you don't 
want to pay for long distance calls.<hr>


<h2>Daily Backup</h2>

Make sure your ISP runs a daily backup routine, otherwise 
you may lose some valuable data.<hr>


<h2>Traffic Volume</h2>

Study the ISP's traffic volume restrictions. Make sure that you don't 
have to pay a fortune for unexpected high traffic if your web site becomes 
popular.<hr>


<h2>Bandwidth or Content Restrictions</h2>

Study the ISP's bandwidth and content restrictions. If you plan to 
publish pictures or broadcast video or sound,&nbsp;make sure that you can.<hr>


<h2>E-mail Capabilities</h2>

Make sure your ISP supports the e-mail capabilities you need.<hr>


<h2>Database Access</h2>

If you plan to use data from databases on your web site, make sure your ISP supports the database access you need.

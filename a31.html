<h2>Media</h2>
Multimedia on the web is sound, music, videos, and animations.<hr>

Modern web browsers have support for many multimedia formats.<hr>

<hr />

<h2>What is Multimedia?</h2>
Multimedia comes in many different formats. It can be almost anything you can hear or see 
like text, pictures, music, 
sound, videos, records, films, animations, and more.<hr>


On the Internet you can often 
find multimedia elements embedded in web pages, and modern web browsers have 
support for a number of multimedia formats. <hr>


In this tutorial you will learn about different multimedia formats and how to 
use them in your web pages.<hr>

<hr />

<h2>Browser Support</h2>
The first Internet browsers had support for text only, and even the text 
support was limited to a single font in a single color. Then came browsers with support for colors, fonts and text styles, and 
the support for pictures was added.<hr>

The support for sounds, animations and videos is handled in different ways by 
different browsers. Some elements can be handled inline, and some requires an 
extra helper program (a plug-in).<hr>

You will learn more about plug-ins in the next chapters. <hr>

<hr />

<h2>Multimedia Formats</h2>
Multimedia elements (like sounds or videos) are stored in media files. <hr>

The most common way to discover the media type is to look at the file 
extension. When a browser sees the file extensions .htm or .html, it will assume that the 
file is an HTML page. The .xml extension indicates an XML file, and the .css 
extension indicates a style sheet. Picture formats are recognized by extensions like .gif and .jpg.<hr>

Multimedia elements also have their own file formats with different extensions 
like .swf, .wmv, .mp3, and .mp4.<hr>

<h2>Video Formats</h2>

computer without an extra (free) component installed. Some later Windows Media 
movies cannot play at all on non-Windows computers because no player is 
available

<td valign="top">.mp4</td>
<td valign="top">
Mpeg-4 (with H.264 video compression) is the new format for the 
internet. In fact, YouTube recommends using MP4. YouTube accepts multiple 
formats, and then converts them all to .flv or .mp4 for distribution. More and 
more online video publishers are moving to MP4 as the internet sharing format 
for both Flash players and HTML5.

<td valign="top">MIDI</td>
<td valign="top">.mid<br />.midi</td>
<td valign="top">
The MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a format for electronic 
music devices like synthesizers and PC sound cards. MIDI files do not contain sound, but digital musical 
instructions (notes) that can be played by electronics (like your PC's sound card).


Since MIDI format only contains instructions 
(notes), MIDI files are extremely small. The example above is only 23K in 
size but it plays for nearly 5 minutes. MIDI is supported by many software systems over a large 
range of platforms. MIDI is supported by all the most popular Internet 
browsers.

<td valign="top">
The WMA format (Windows Media Audio), compares in quality to 
MP3, and is compatible with most players, except the iPod. WMA files can be

Internet radio or on-line music.

<td valign="top">MP3</td>
<td valign="top">.mp3<br />.mpga</td>
<td valign="top">
MP3 files are actually the sound part of MPEG files. The MPEG format was originally 
developed for video by the Moving Pictures Experts Group.
MP3 is one of the most popular sound formats for music. The  
encoding system combines good compression (small files) with high quality. 
Expect future software systems to support it.

<h2>What Format To Use?</h2>
The WAVE is the most popular <strong>uncompressed</strong> sound format on the Internet, and 
it is supported by all popular browsers. If you want uncompressed sound (music or 
speech) to be available to all your visitors, you should use the WAVE format.<hr>

The MP3 format is the newest format for <strong>compressed</strong> recorded music. 
The term MP3 has become synonymous with digital music. If your 
website is about recorded music, the MP3 format is the choice.

				  <h1>CSS - 2. CSS Selectors, Properties, and Values</h1>


Whereas <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> has <strong>tags</strong>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> has '<strong>selectors</strong>'. Selectors are the names given to styles in internal and external style sheets. In this CSS Beginner Tutorial we will be concentrating on <strong>HTML selectors</strong>, which are simply the names of HTML tags and are used to change the style of a specific tag.<hr><br>



					<div id="antiintro"><div id="ai2"></div>



For each selector there are '<strong>properties</strong>' inside <strong>curly brackets</strong>, 
which simply take the form of words such as color, font-weight or background-color.<hr><br>

A <strong>value</strong> is given to the property following a <strong>colon</strong> (NOT an 'equals' sign) and <strong>semi-colons</strong> separate the properties.<hr><br>

<blockquote style="background-color:#F0FFFF;padding:5px 5px 5px 5px;">

<strong>body {</strong><br>

	<strong>font-size: 0.8em;</strong><Br>

	<strong>color: navy;</strong><Br>

<strong>}</strong><Br>

</blockquote>



This will apply the given values to the font-size and colorproperties to the <code >body</code> selector.<hr><br>

So basically, when this is applied to an HTML document, text between the body tags (which is the content of the whole window)
 will be 0.8 ems in size and navy in colour.<hr><br>



<h2>Lengths and Percentages</h2>

There are many property-specific units for values used in CSS, but there are some general units that are used in a number of properties and it is worth familiarising yourself with these before continuing.<hr><br>

<strong>em</strong> (such as <code>font-size: 2em</code>) is the unit for the <strong>calculated size of a font</strong>. So "2em", for example, is two times the current font size.<hr><br>

<strong>px</strong> (such as <code>font-size: 12px</code>) is the unit for <strong>pixels</strong>.<hr><br>

<strong>pt</strong> (such as <code>font-size: 12pt</code>) is the unit for <strong>points</strong>.<hr><br>

<strong>%</strong> (such as <code>font-size: 80%</code>) is the unit for... wait for it... <strong>percentages</strong>.<hr><br>

Other units include <strong>pc</strong> (picas), <strong>cm</strong> (centimetres), <strong>mm</strong> (millimetres) and <strong>in</strong> (inches).<hr><br>



When a value is <strong>zero</strong>, you do not need to state a unit. For example, if you wanted to specify no border, it would be <code>border: 0</code>.<hr><br>





A web page is not a static, absolute medium. It is meant to be flexible and the user should be allowed to view the web page how the hell they like, which includes the font size <em>and</em> the size of the screen.<hr><br>

Because of this, it is generally accepted that 'em' or '%' are the best units to use for font-sizes (and possibly even heights and widths,
					  which we shall come across in the CSS Advanced Tutorial), rather than 'px', which leads to non-resizable text in most browsers, and should be used sparingly, for border sizes for example.</div>

<h2>JavaScript While Loop</h2>
The while loop is an advanced programming technique that allows you to do something over and over <i>while</i> a conditional statement is true. Although the general uses of the <i>while loop</i> are usually a bit complex, this lesson will teach you the basics of how to create a <i>while loop</i> in JavaScript.<hr>


<h2>JavaScript While Loop Explained</h2>
There are two key parts to a JavaScript <i>while loop</i>:<hr>

<ol>
	<li>The conditional statement which must be <i>True</i> for the <i>while loop's</i> code to be executed.</li>
	<li>The <i>while loop's</i> code that is contained in curly braces "{ and }" will be executed if the condition is <i>True</i>.</li>
</ol>

When a <i>while loop</i> begins, the JavaScript interpreter checks if the condition statement is true. If it is, the code between the curly braces is executed.  At the end of the code segment "}", the <i>while loop</i> loops back to the condition statement and begins again. <hr>

If the condition statement is always <i>True</i>, then you will never exit the <i>while loop</i>, so be <b>very careful</b> when using while loops!<hr>

<h2>Creating a Simple While Loop</h2>
This example shows how to create a basic <i>while loop</i> that will execute a <i>document.write</i> 10 times and then exit the loop statement.<hr>

<blockquote style="background-color:#F0FFFF;padding:5px 5px 5px 5px;"><h2 class='specialT'>JavaScript Code:</h2><pre class='code'>
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
&lt;!--
var myCounter = 0;
var linebreak = "&lt;br /&gt;";
document.write("While loop is beginning");
document.write(linebreak);

<font color='red'>while(myCounter &lt; 10){
	<indent>document.write("myCounter = " + myCounter);
	document.write(linebreak);
	myCounter++;</indent>
}</font>

document.write("While loop is finished!");
&lt;/script&gt;

</pre></blockquote>

<h2 class='specialT'>Display:</h2><blockquote style="background-color:#F0FFFF;padding:5px 5px 5px 5px;">
  While loop is beginning
  <br>myCounter = 0
  <br>myCounter = 1
  <br>myCounter = 2
  <br>myCounter = 3
  <br>myCounter = 4
  <br>myCounter = 5
  <br>myCounter = 6
  <br>myCounter = 7
  <br>myCounter = 8
  <br>myCounter = 9
  <br>While loop is finished!
</blockquote>


Our variable <i>myCounter</i> started off at 0, which is less than 10, so our while loop executed its code.  The value 0 was printed to the browser and then <i>myCounter</i> was incremented by 1 and the while loop started over again.<hr>

1 was less than 10 so the while loop's code was executed... and the process repeats itself a few more times until...<hr>

<i>myCounter</i> was 10 which was not less than 10 so the while loop's code did not execute.  You can see this in the <i>Display:</i> because the last value to be printed out was 9.<hr>


Note:  Advanced programmers may recognize that a <i>for loop</i> would be a better solution for this example, but we hope you can ignore this for our needs to create an easy example!
